**Testability**

| Symbol | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTOMATED` | Completed through direct Suite-to-target communication (no browser) | 96 |
| `BROWSER` | Requires the user's browser | 216 |
| `ATTESTED` | The user attests to behavior inside the target | 53 |

| `NOT_OBSERVABLE` | Fundamentally unverifiable externally; no case is created | 1 |

**Verdict notes**

- The sole source of verdict levels is `tests/coverage.yaml`.
- Cases return `outcome`; the Evaluator maps it to Verdict by consulting `level` ([03 §4](03-test-model.md)).
- `NOT_APPLICABLE` is limited to role mismatch and false conditional-obligation conditions. Anything that could not be executed is `NOT_VERIFIED`.
- **Core / Full is Samlier's own classification**; the IIP source does not make this distinction.

## Requirements and Obligations

### 2.1 Common / General

#### IIP-G01

[Source](https://kantarainitiative.github.io/SAMLprofiles/fedinterop.html#IIP-G01) / Section digest `sha256:53941f0bef83…` / Section length 781 / Non-normative spans 3

| Obligation | Level | Role | Testability | Condition | Core/Full | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IIP-G01.a` | MUST | idp/sp | `BROWSER` | — | core | Allow for reasonable clock skew when interpreting xsd:dateTime values and enforcing policy based on them |

<details><summary><code>IIP-G01.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-e58a6e87cd` Shift IssueInstant within the target-attested tolerance T, to T-delta; it should be accepted. This is the only verdict-affecting check.
  - `v-5c725f9df6` Shift NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter by T-delta; they should be accepted.
  - `v-cb7eb7556e` Shift metadata validUntil by T-delta; it should be accepted.
  - `v-469ba48d06` Information only: behavior when shifted outside T, to T+delta. Acceptance is not a violation.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Samlier has no absolute threshold. Judge only whether a value inside the tolerance T attested by the target is accepted.
  - Correction: the previous version treated acceptance at T+delta as violated, but the source requires allowing reasonable skew, not rejecting anything beyond it. That would fail conforming implementations with wider tolerance. Record behavior outside the boundary as advisory clock_skew.very_permissive and exclude it from the verdict.
  - If T cannot be attested, return NOT_VERIFIED. Configurability is not required by the source, so its absence is not a violation.
- **Configuration failure semantics**: `test_precondition`
- **Notes**: The source establishes no universal number of seconds that must be accepted; "3–5 minutes" is italicized and non-normative. The previous mandatory ±180-second variant could violate a conforming implementation configured for 120 seconds. If T cannot be attested or configured, return NOT_VERIFIED. Record excessive tolerance as advisory clock_skew.very_permissive and exclude it from the verdict.

#### IIP-G02

[Source](https://kantarainitiative.github.io/SAMLprofiles/fedinterop.html#IIP-G02) / Section digest `sha256:1ca7eb8542d7…` / Section length 566 / Non-normative spans 1

| Obligation | Level | Role | Testability | Condition | Core/Full | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IIP-G02.a` | MUST | idp/sp | `BROWSER` | — | core | Accept, without error, xs:string values of any valid XML characters up to 256 characters |
| `IIP-G02.b` | MUST | sp | `CONFIG` | — | core | A Service Provider must not truncate received xs:string values of up to 256 characters |
| `IIP-G02.c` | MUST | idp | `ATTESTED` | — | core | An Identity Provider must not truncate received xs:string values of up to 256 characters |

<details><summary><code>IIP-G02.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-dffad0561a` Standard type: a 256-character transient NameID, matching the SAML2Core 8.3.8 maximum.
  - `v-3906636ecf` Standard type: a 256-character persistent NameID, matching the SAML2Core 8.3.7 maximum.
  - `v-e5e955eb1c` Standard type: 256 characters in AuthnRequest/@ProviderName.
  - `v-ac5c0aa54a` User-defined type: 256 characters in a value of a user-schema xs:string-derived type, such as <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type="myns:MyStringType">.
  - `v-e2eb9ead4d` User-defined type: 256 characters in an xs:string-typed attribute of a user-defined element inside samlp:Extensions.
  - `v-3bb6d4de96` User-defined type: 256 characters in xs:string-typed element content of a user-defined element inside saml:Advice.
  - `v-cb2b5ca561` Character category: the len=255 boundary.
  - `v-b53cde0652` Character category: the len=256 boundary.
  - `v-940be55376` Character category: non-ASCII characters, including CJK and Cyrillic.
  - `v-07bc620a46` Character category: combining characters whose normalization changes length.
  - `v-e63f47012d` Character category: supplementary-plane code points; do not generate isolated surrogates.
  - `v-8932a64395` Character category: TAB and LF encoded as character references, because literals are normalized to spaces in XML attributes.
  - `v-45ac9759d7` Character category: XML-special characters (<, &, double quote, single quote, >) encoded using character or entity references.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Test both axes: type category and character category. Passing only standard types does not verify that the requirement also applies to user-defined types.
  - This obligation judges only absence of an error. Truncation is judged under IIP-G02.b for an SP and IIP-G02.c for an IdP.
  - Control: detect an implementation that accepts 255 characters but rejects 256; two cases spanning the boundary are mandatory.
  - Literal TAB and LF are normalized to spaces in XML attribute values. Use separate literal and character-reference cases and compare values after XML parsing.
  - Count length in Unicode code points.
- **Applicability**: Applicability is limited by the opening clause, "where no SAML standard or profile-specific constraint exists." Select fields for which SAML imposes no length or character-set constraint.
- **Notes**: The transcript suffices as acceptance evidence: no error response and completion of the flow. However, user-defined types in samlp:Extensions or saml:Advice may be ignored, so success does not distinguish acceptance from ignoring. Whether content was not ignored and not truncated is observed separately under IIP-G02.b/.c. Use a field known to be xs:string; saml:Attribute/@Name and @FriendlyName are schema-defined SAML types and are not controls for a user-defined type.
- **source_clauses**: `[81, 291)` `sha256:d07e84e7979b…` , `[293, 435)` `sha256:fe98afa5ffc2…`
- **review**: `PENDING_REVIEW` / reviewer: `None` / approved_at: `None`

</details>

<details><summary><code>IIP-G02.b</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-bbec42f7c8` Read back the received transient and persistent NameIDs and verify that all 256 code points are preserved.
  - `v-1a367fbed8` Read back the received standard-type saml:AttributeValue and verify that all 256 code points are preserved.
  - `v-eeb2369cc7` Read back the received user-defined AttributeValue type identified by xsi:type and verify that its value is preserved.
  - `v-207e07ddfe` Character category: non-ASCII characters, combining characters, and supplementary-plane code points are not lost.
  - `v-f6d79585b0` Character category: TAB and LF sent as character references are preserved in the post-XML-parsing value.
  - `v-ab7394032c` Control: detect an implementation for which 255 characters match exactly but the final character is missing only at 256.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - A successful response is not evidence of non-truncation. Unknown content in samlp:Extensions or saml:Advice may be ignored, so success alone cannot distinguish ignored, truncated, and preserved content.
  - Read back through the target's observation surface. Compare the value sent by the Suite with the value read from the target as sequences of Unicode code points.
  - If no readback path can be provided, return not_verified(no_readback_path), not target nonconformance.
- **Configuration failure semantics**: `test_precondition`
- **Applicability**: Applicability is the same as IIP-G02.a. This obligation covers only non-truncation and requires a value-readback path.
- **Notes**: Example readback paths are an SP attribute-display endpoint such as a Shibboleth Session handler, a diagnostic page in the target application, or session information issued by the target. Register the URL and reading procedure during Test Plan preflight; the Suite performs the comparison automatically. If no path exists, return not_verified rather than falling back to attestation, as with IIP-G02.c; SPs ordinarily expose readback, and attestation would remove detection power.
- **source_clauses**: `[81, 291)` `sha256:d07e84e7979b…` , `[293, 435)` `sha256:fe98afa5ffc2…`
- **review**: `PENDING_REVIEW` / reviewer: `None` / approved_at: `None`

</details>

<details><summary><code>IIP-G02.c</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-5fd589e897` When a round-trip path exists, set 256 characters in samlp:ManageNameIDRequest/samlp:NewID, whose schema type is string, and verify that a later Assertion returns SPProvidedID with the identical 256 code points. Automatic comparison is possible only when SAML2Core 3.6 is supported.
  - `v-59304685a7` Without a round-trip path, use attestation to confirm that the 256 characters sent in AuthnRequest/@ProviderName, NameIDPolicy/@SPNameQualifier, and samlp:Extensions are not truncated in the target's administration UI, audit log, or session information.
  - `v-12bc7d3a9f` Character category: confirm through the same path that non-ASCII characters, combining characters, and supplementary-plane code points are not lost.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Prefer a variant with a round-trip path, SPProvidedID. Attestation-only and automatically compared results occupy different evidence-ladder grades.
  - The SPProvidedID round trip shares the observation used by IIP-SSO05.a5, but the judged properties differ: provenance there and length preservation here.
  - If attestation is unavailable, return not_verified(attestation_unavailable), not target nonconformance.
- **Applicability**: Applicability is the same as IIP-G02.a. Many IdPs do not re-emit accepted xs:string values through the protocol surface, so observation is generally attested.
- **Notes**: IIP-G02.a acceptance and this non-truncation obligation are separate because a successful response cannot be distinguished from ignoring. No IdP readback surface is standardized; automatic comparison is possible only for implementations supporting SAML2Core 3.6 Name Identifier Management.
- **source_clauses**: `[81, 291)` `sha256:d07e84e7979b…` , `[293, 435)` `sha256:fe98afa5ffc2…`

  - The obligation to interoperate within the scope of the default policy without additional peer-specific configuration is assessed exactly once, under the explicit text of IIP-MD06.b.
  - This group of obligations concerns only interpretation and application after acceptance. Structural acceptance of MDIOP-shaped XML is assessed under the IIP-MD05.c group.

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-2aa671608e` SP-initiated happy path: protected resource → AuthnRequest → authentication → Response → resource access
  - `v-d462b4546b` Request via Redirect / response via POST (the same combination as IIP-SSO02 and IIP-SSO03)
  - `v-c8f2acaa60` Request via POST / response via POST
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ This obligation is a comprehensive case that checks only that the profile works end to end. It must not be treated as having exercised each individual normative sentence
  - ★ The happy path alone has no detection power. The individual obligations from IIP-SSO01.b onward provide the controls
  - ★ Correction: The previous version made the IdP-initiated (unsolicited) happy path a required variant, but initiation in §4.1.5 is MAY (IIP-SSO01.z). Making it required would mark a conforming IdP that does not issue unsolicited responses as FAIL. Obligations specific to unsolicited responses were placed conditionally in IIP-SSO01.y/.y1
- **Referenced specification**: `SAML2Prof#4.1`
- **Reference basis (SAML2Prof)**; locator: `4\.1 Web Browser SSO Profile||4\.2 Enhanced Client or Proxy`: The Web Browser SSO Profile as a whole. Individual normative sentences are decomposed from IIP-SSO01.b onward
- **Notes**: 【CP1 reconciliation record】On 2026-08-27, §4.1 (with Errata applied), incorporation sentence A, and incorporation sentence B were rechecked bidirectionally: omission checking (source text → obligations) and overreach checking (obligations → effective source text). The Errata replacement precedence was confirmed, and the obsolete §6.2 removed by E43/E93, the former SessionNotOnOrAfter MUST removed by E79, and the former RSA-SHA1 SHOULD removed by E81 were excluded from generation targets. The following is the authoritative source for the mapping table. 【RFC2119 sentences in §4.1 → obligation mapping】 4.1.1: use the bearer confirmation method → .fr; the SHOULD added by E47 to identify the intended attesting entity for the bearer method → .fr; the SHOULD for multiple SubjectConfirmations for multiple attesting entities → .gd. 4.1.2: do not use Redirect for the response → .x; the SP MAY use Discovery → IIP-SP04. 4.1.3.1: RelayState MAY be used → note on .ab; expose as little of the original request as possible (SHOULD) → .ac. 4.1.3.2: Discovery, redirection to another service, and use of metadata (all MAY) → permissions, creating no obligations. 4.1.3.3: operation over TLS is RECOMMENDED → .ad; signing the AuthnRequest is MAY → permission; “IdP MUST process the <AuthnRequest> as described in [SAMLCore]” is an incorporation sentence, and the incorporated SAML2Core normative sentences were expanded under 【Incorporation sentence A】 below. 4.1.3.4: establish the principal's identity (MUST) → .ae. 4.1.3.5: generate an HTTP response containing a Response/artifact regardless of success or failure (SHOULD, with error responses strengthened by E85) → success path .a/.g, error path IIP-IDP05.a (IIP strengthened it to MUST); verify that the ACS location is under the SP's control (MUST) → IIP-IDP12.b; honor the specified binding and ACS where possible (MUST) → IIP-IDP12.a/.e/.f; TLS is RECOMMENDED → .ad; POST-time Assertion/Response signing (MUST, reflecting E26/E93) → .v; Response signing for CBC-mode EncryptedAssertion (SHOULD, E93) → .fv; “SP MUST process the <Response> as described in [SAMLCore]” is an incorporation sentence: profile-specific processing rules are .n–.r1, and the incorporated general SAML2Core rules are 【Incorporation sentence B】 below. 4.1.3.6: establishing a security context is MAY → permission. 4.1.4.1: Issuer (MUST) → .b; error response when the request cannot be satisfied (MUST) → IIP-IDP05.a; do not include SubjectConfirmation in Subject (MUST NOT) → .c; error when the principal cannot be recognized (MUST) → .d; do not rely on information from an unauthenticated request (MUST NOT) → .e; ACS validation (MUST) → IIP-IDP12.b; ★ the former Profile MUST “if an SP wants creation of a new identifier, it must include AllowCreate=true” was removed from §4.1.4.1 by SAML2Errata E14. The new rule E14 added to Core 3.4.1.1 is decomposed into .fl–.fp under incorporation sentence A. 4.1.4.2 (reflecting E17/E26/E52): .f–.m; ignoring the Address attribute, additional statements, and AttributeConsumingServiceIndex is MAY → permissions; “if the conditions are not understood and accepted by the SP, the assertion is not valid” is SP-side processing and included in .r. 4.1.4.3 (reflecting E26/E93): .n–.t; Response signing for CBC-mode EncryptedAssertion (SHOULD) → .fv; matching Address is MAY → permission. 4.1.4.4: .u/.u1. “using the Artifact Resolution profile” identifies the artifact reference-resolution mechanism, but the additional normative content explicitly stated by this section is mutual authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and restriction to the intended SP; decompose it into these two obligations. Do not recursively double-count the entire Artifact Resolution Profile §5 under SSO01. 4.1.4.5 (reflecting E26): .v/.w. 4.1.5 (including the E90 addition): initiation is MAY → .z; do not include InResponseTo (MUST NOT) → .y; delivery to the default ACS (SHOULD) → .y1; the SP should be able to handle unsolicited responses (SHOULD) → .y2; the SP should be able to disable acceptance of unsolicited responses (SHOULD, E90) → .aa; RelayState transfer is MAY → permission. E90 adds new §4.1.6 “Use of Relay State”: limit the URL scheme to https/http (SHOULD) → .ab. The OS edition's §4.1.6 “Use of Metadata”: IIP-SSO06 directly handles the same section, so it is not duplicated here. ★ Because E90 inserts a new §4.1.6 into the Errata-applied edition, section number 4.1.6 refers to different sections in the OS edition (“Use of Metadata”) and the Errata-applied edition (“Use of Relay State”). IIP-SSO06 specifies the section title as well, so it unambiguously refers to the OS-edition section. 【Incorporation sentence A: IdP MUST process the <AuthnRequest> as described in [SAMLCore]】The incorporated scope is the syntax, validation, and processing of <AuthnRequest>, plus the dependency closure of common rules directly referenced by that processing. The authoritative source is the section-by-section mapping table below (§1.1, §1.3, §3.2.1, §3.3.2.2.1, §3.4.1–§3.4.1.5.1, §4, §5, §6), not a short list of section numbers. Independent protocols such as §3.5 Artifact Resolution and §3.6 Name Identifier Management are out of scope except for normative sentences individually incorporated by Profile §4.1 or the mapping table. §1.1 Notation (the schema document is authoritative for syntax) plus protocol/assertion schema: SP AuthnRequest → .cg; IdP Response → .dv; IdP Assertion/AuthnStatement → .dw; proxy IdP AuthnRequest (conditional) → .dx. ★ Obligations are separated by role (because variants have no role field; assigning idp/sp to one obligation would make it appear in G2 that a variant for one role must also cover the other role). §1.3.1 strings: at least one non-whitespace character → .dz; exact binary comparison → .ea; do not ignore case, normalize whitespace, or rely on locale conversion → .eb; compare different encodings using NFC → .ec; account for XML normalization when comparing with external data → .ed; do not rely on sort order → .ee. §1.3.2 URI: at least one non-whitespace character and an absolute URI → .ef. §1.3.3 time: UTC without a timezone → .eg; do not rely on sub-millisecond resolution (SHOULD NOT) → .eh; do not generate leap seconds → .ei; E92’s reasonable clock-skew SHOULD is strengthened to MUST and handled directly by IIP-G01. §1.3.4: do not assign the same value to different objects → .af (SP)/.ao (IdP; both <Response>/@ID and <Assertion>/@ID); exactly one declaration → .cc; collision probability ≤2^-128 when randomness is used → .cd; the same ≤2^-160 (SHOULD) → .ce; PRNG seed → .cf. §3.2.1: request @ID and response @InResponseTo match → .ap; match and discard on @Destination → .ag; namespace-qualify extension elements → .ah; verify signatures → .ai; do not rely on content when the signature is invalid → .aj; error response for an invalid signature (SHOULD) → .ak; evaluate signer identity and validity (SHOULD) → .al; sign requests with Consent (SHOULD) → .am (SP)/.gh (proxy IdP); <StatusCode> when responding to an invalid request (MUST) → .an. §3.4.1 body and §3.4.1.1 NameIDPolicy: ForceAuthn → IIP-IDP06; IsPassive → IIP-IDP07; authentication and integrity protection of AuthnRequest by signature or binding (SHOULD) → .fj (SP)/.fx (proxy IdP); basic NameIDPolicy processing → IIP-IDP10; E14’s new AllowCreate rule → .fl–.fp (.fl/.fm explicitly state the “do not use for specific purposes” condition in the predicate); three ACS attributes → IIP-IDP12; RequestedAuthnContext exact → IIP-IDP08, minimum/better/maximum → .ga/.gb/.gc, priority evaluation of candidates → .gj; AttributeConsumingServiceIndex → IIP-IDP04.b; Subject → IIP-SSO01.c/.d and IIP-SSO07.b; ProviderName and Consent have no processing rule and are information recorded by IIP-SSO07.b. §3.4.1.2 <Scoping>: the only RFC2119 obligation is the MAY for “profiles specifying an active intermediary” → permission. §3.4.1.3 <IDPList>: MUST for the result of resolving <GetComplete> → .av. §3.4.1.4 processing rules: an assertion satisfying the request's specification or an error response → IIP-IDP10.d; error response when authentication fails, the subject is unknown, or policy rejects → IIP-IDP05.a and .d; strongly match <Subject> → IIP-SSO07.b; implications when content is empty (AuthnStatement/AudienceRestriction) → .l/.m. §3.4.1.5 and §3.4.1.5.1 proxying: .aw–.bj (all conditioned on supports_authnrequest_proxying). ★ E65 replaced the former ProxyCount=0 “MUST NOT proxy / secondary ProxyCountExceeded MUST”; accordingly .aw is the top-level Responder MUST and .ax is the secondary ProxyCountExceeded MAY. §4 version processing: issue requests using the highest version supported by both parties (SHOULD) → .fg (SP)/.ge (proxy IdP); assume one's own highest version when the responder's capability is unknown (SHOULD) → .fh (SP)/.gf (proxy IdP); do not issue assertions with an unsupported version → .ej; do not process assertions with an unsupported major version → .ek; do not issue a request corresponding to a response version the implementation cannot handle → .el (SP)/.gg (proxy IdP); reject requests with an unsupported major version → .em; do not issue a response with a version higher than the request → .en; do not issue a lower major version than the request (except when reporting VersionMismatch) → .eo; top-level VersionMismatch for incompatibility → .ep; do not include a V1 assertion in a V2 response → .eq. ★ The exception in .eo is limited to the secondary code RequestVersionTooHigh, not VersionMismatch in general. “A request with a higher minor version MAY be processed or rejected” and “a request sharing the same major version MUST have the same processing rules” are not obligations (the latter is a specification-property declaration, not an implementation obligation). §4.2 namespace-version handling is a norm for specification authors and creates no obligation. The SHOULD for future extensibility and SHOULD to reject unknown extensions with mandatory semantics in §4.2.1 are assessed through IIP-SSO07.b and IIP-EXT01, which directly specify processing results by content type; do not double-count them. §5 XML Signature profile: enveloped signatures → .er; ★ the former RSA-SHA1 support SHOULD creates no obligation because E81 replaced it with “any XML Signature algorithm MAY be used”; signatures on assertions obtained from parties other than the issuer (SHOULD) → .es; signatures on messages received from parties other than the sender (SHOULD) → .et (IdP Response)/.fj (SP AuthnRequest); ID of the signed root → .eu; **a single <ds:Reference> and same-document reference → .ev**; Exclusive C14N (SHOULD) → .ew; do not include unauthorized transforms (SHOULD NOT) → .ex; **if unauthorized transforms are accepted, ensure that no content is excluded from the signature → .ey (SP)/.fk (IdP)**; <ds:KeyInfo> MAY be omitted → permission; E91’s <ds:Object> SHOULD NOT be sent → .fs, and verifier SHOULD reject it → .ft (SP)/.fu (IdP); §5.3 signature inheritance is advisory because it uses lowercase “should.” §6 encryption: replacement at the same location remaining after E30 → .ez (assertion)/.fd (identifier)/.fe (attribute); §6.1 @Type → .dm/.dn (same rule as §2.2.4). ★ The OS edition's §6.2 “verify/decrypt in reverse order / encrypt the assertion after signing / outer-sign identifiers and attributes after encryption” was replaced in its entirety by E43 with the Key and Data Referencing Guidelines, and then by E93 with Encryption and Integrity Protection. Therefore .fa/.fb/.fc/.ff derived from the former §6.2 do not exist after applying the Errata and must be deleted. The current §6.2’s SHOULD for integrity protection before processing CBC-encrypted data → .fw; the SHOULD added to Profile 4.1 for Response signing → .fv. ★ .ez/.fd/.fe are passive rules for each encrypted element actually sent; if none is observed, return satisfied_with_note. ★ .er/.eu/.ev/.ew/.ex have no conditions. The §5.4 constraints apply to each XML signature actually generated at runtime, not to products capable of signing; passively inspect each signature sent by the target, and if no signature is observed, return satisfied_with_note. ★ .ey also has no condition. Applicability is evaluated before case execution, so conditioning it on whether the target accepted the message would cause the observation case to be skipped before observation, creating a cycle. Evaluate each transform as follows: rejected → satisfied; accepted but excludes no content → satisfied; accepted and the signature excludes content → violated; inability to determine whether content was excluded → not_verified. The source requires “no content of the SAML message is excluded from the signature,” not merely that excluded content is unused. Received messages differ by role (SP: <Response>/<Assertion>; IdP: <AuthnRequest>), so obligations are separated by role. An identity transform permits only a binary accept/reject outcome, so it is not a required variant; place it in Suite-side fixture self-validation and do not let it affect the target verdict. Self-validation checks only that the fixture signature is cryptographically valid and that the identity transform excludes no content. The target remains conforming even if it rejects solely because an unauthorized transform is present; do not distinguish rejection reasons. ★ .fk always sends a signed AuthnRequest. Whether the target requires signatures and whether it correctly verifies a received signature are separate obligations. Return not_verified only if the Suite SP's key cannot be trusted. ★ .ev/.ey directly detect XML Signature Wrapping. 【Incorporation sentence B: SP MUST process the <Response> and enclosed <Assertion> as described in [SAMLCore]】The incorporated scope is the syntax, validation, and processing of <Response> and its enclosed <Assertion>, plus the dependency closure of common rules they directly reference. The authoritative source is the mapping table below (§2 in its entirety, §3.2.2, §3.2.2.2, and §1/§4/§5/§6 explicitly listed as common rules), not a short list of section numbers. §3.5 Artifact Resolution is a separate protocol and is not recursively incorporated by this sentence except for the two normative sentences explicitly stated by Profile §4.1.4.4 (IIP-SSO01.u/.u1). §3.2.2: @ID uniqueness → .ao; @InResponseTo required and matching in responses to requests → .ap; prohibit @InResponseTo in unsolicited responses → .y; prohibit the error path when the request ID cannot be identified → .gi; match and discard on @Destination → .aq; namespace-qualify extension elements → .ah; verify signatures → .n; do not rely on content when the signature is invalid → .ar; treat an invalid signature as an error (SHOULD) → .as; evaluate signer identity and validity (SHOULD) → .at; sign responses with Consent (SHOULD) → .au. §3.2.2.2: top-level <StatusCode>/@Value is a value from the top-level list → .ch. ★ The scope of incorporation sentence B is all of §2, SAML Assertions (the previous version was limited primarily to §2.5 Conditions). The section mapping is as follows; reasons are given for sections that create no obligation. §2.1 schema declarations: no normative sentence. §2.2.1 <BaseID>/§2.2.2 NameIDType: omission of NameQualifier/SPNameQualifier (SHOULD) → .cy. §2.2.3 <NameID>: no normative sentence (rules by Format are in §8.3 and handled by IIP-SSO05). §2.2.4 <EncryptedID>: presence of @Type (SHOULD) → .dm; value of @Type → .dn; type of encrypted content (NameIDType or AssertionType, and their derived types) → .do; **ciphertext uniqueness → .dp (this MUST is located only in §2.2.4, so it is limited to <EncryptedID>)**; Recipient of the wrapped key (SHOULD) → .dq. §2.2.5 <Issuer>: no RFC2119 sentence. The consequence of the default Format entity is .h/.i; omission of qualifier attributes is .cy. §2.3.1 <AssertionIDRef>/§2.3.2 <AssertionURIRef>: no normative sentence. Web Browser SSO carries assertions by value, so reference forms are not used. §2.3.3 <Assertion>: @ID uniqueness → .ao; required @Version/@IssueInstant/<Issuer> → .dw (generation)/.cx (reception rejection); xsi:type on <Statement> → .ci; an assertion without a statement contains <Subject> → .cj; signature verification → .n; do not rely on an assertion with an invalid signature → .fy; evaluate the assertion issuer (SHOULD) → .fz; “the issuer should be unambiguous to the relying party” (SHOULD) is subsumed by .i (MUST). §2.3.4 <EncryptedAssertion>: .dm/.dn/.do/.dq. §2.4.1 <Subject>: do not identify two or more subjects (SHOULD NOT) → .cz (inspect semantic multiplicity, including identifiers inside <SubjectConfirmation>, not only the schema choice constraint). §2.4.1.1 <SubjectConfirmation>: E47’s addition “if used by an entity different from the Subject, identify that entity (SHOULD)” → .fr; bearer requirements → .j/.k (from SAML2Prof). §2.4.1.2 <SubjectConfirmationData>: namespace for extension attributes → .da; validity interval lies within the assertion (SHOULD; **both upper and lower bounds**) → .db; NotBefore < NotOnOrAfter → .dc; @Address notation (SHOULD) → .ds; bearer prohibition of Recipient/NotOnOrAfter/NotBefore/InResponseTo → .k/.k1/.k2. §2.4.1.3 KeyInfoConfirmationDataType: **creates no obligation**. “The confirmation method defines the mechanism” is a norm for specification authors, not an implementation obligation; the remainder is specific to holder-of-key confirmation, while Web Browser SSO uses bearer (.j). ECP holder-of-key is handled separately by IIP-IDP13. §2.5 Conditions: as follows. §2.6 <Advice>: optional content that may be ignored, handled by IIP-EXT01. §2.7.1 <Statement>: xsi:type → .ci. §2.7.2 <AuthnStatement>: required <Subject> → .dd; required @AuthnInstant/<AuthnContext> → .dw/.cx; ★ the former SessionNotOnOrAfter MUST to treat the session as ended was replaced by E79 with an explanation of the upper bound and creates no obligation. In Web Browser SSO, apply only the concrete processing rule in Profile 4.1.4.3, .t (SHOULD); prevent SessionIndex correlation (SHOULD NOT) → .de; two recommended methods (RECOMMENDED) → .dy; cardinality of method (a)'s value range (SHOULD) → .df; random selection for method (a) (SHOULD) → .dg; SessionIndex required when SLO is supported → .l1. ★ .df/.dg are internal rules for method (a) in the source, so they are conditioned on the predicate uses_small_integer_sessionindex. They do not apply to implementations using method (b), which uses the assertion's @ID. §2.7.2.1 <SubjectLocality>: @Address notation (SHOULD) → .ds. §2.7.2.2 <AuthnContext>: no profile-specific RFC2119 sentence. Request-side handling is IIP-IDP08/IIP-SP06/IIP-SP07. §2.7.3 <AttributeStatement>: required <Subject> → .dh. §2.7.3.1 <Attribute>: do not use @FriendlyName as the basis for identification → IIP-SP11.a; namespace for extension attributes → .di; omit <AttributeValue> when the attribute has no value → .dj; **represent multiple discrete values in separate <AttributeValue> elements (RECOMMENDED) → .du**; “if multiple <AttributeValue> elements have xsi:type, all must have the same type” uses lowercase “must” and is advisory; “other uses must define semantics” is a **norm for specification authors** and creates no obligation. §2.7.3.1.1 <AttributeValue>: empty value → .dk; null value → .dl. §2.7.3.2 <EncryptedAttribute>: .dm/.dn/.do/.dq. §2.7.4 <AuthzDecisionStatement> and below: **creates no obligation**. The Web Browser SSO Profile does not use authorization decision statements; handling when an IdP includes one is covered by IIP-SSO07.b (unsupported optional content). The SHOULD group for URI normalization is specific to authorization-decision resources and out of scope for this profile. §2.5.1 <Conditions>: xsi:type on <Condition> → .ck; at most one <OneTimeUse> → .cl; at most one <ProxyRestriction> → .cm. §2.5.1.1: reject Invalid/Indeterminate assertions → .co. §2.5.1.2: NotBefore < NotOnOrAfter → .cn; validate the interval → .p/.r. §2.5.1.4: independently evaluate multiple <AudienceRestriction> elements → .cp; SP entityID in <Audience> → .m. §2.5.1.5 <OneTimeUse>: use immediately (SHOULD) → .cq; do not retain for future use → .cr; implementations that retain it must comply → .cs; at most one → .cl. §2.5.1.6 <ProxyRestriction>: do not issue assertions violating the restriction → .ct; Count=0 → .cu; decrement Count → .cv; scope of <Audience> → .cw; at most one → .cm. Validation of the §2.5 Conditions interval and Audience itself is .r. Among the details of §1.3.4, the @ID of an AuthnRequest generated upstream by a proxy IdP is .dr (conditional).

  - ★ Correction: The previous version placed “a URL with an https / http scheme → transition successfully” as a required variant, but E90 does not impose an obligation to accept or transition to RelayState values using http / https. An implementation that accepts no absolute URLs at all, or one that treats RelayState as an opaque token, is also conformant. Transitions using http / https are used only as Suite-side control fixtures (to verify that detection of prohibited schemes is not vacuously satisfied by an implementation that never transitions) and do not affect the target’s verdict

  - `v-b254b6de3f` Control: only the path of the original resource is present in RelayState → do not determine violated on this basis alone (depending on the state-retention method, it may be the minimum necessary for restoration)
  - `v-65479ca7d2` Control: RelayState is an opaque token → satisfied (although opacity is not required)

  - (1) Information unnecessary for restoration is exposed → violated (WARNING because this is SHOULD_CLASS)
  - (2) It cannot be determined whether the contents are the minimum necessary → not_verified
  - (3) The original URL string is merely included → do not determine violated on this basis alone
  - Correction: The previous version required that the original URL, query, and identifiers not appear verbatim, but the source says “as little ... as possible” and does not require complete non-occurrence. Depending on the state-retention method, the minimum necessary path or identifier may be included; therefore, applying the previous rule as written would issue a WARNING for a conforming SP.
  - ★ Determining (1) requires a criterion for what is necessary for restoration. During preflight, require the target to declare its state-retention method (what it places in RelayState); if the declaration conflicts with the observation, return INCONSISTENT. If there is no declaration, fall back to not_verified as in (2).
  - ★ SAML bindings specify that RelayState must be no more than 80 bytes. Looking only at length could incorrectly determine that a value is non-revealing because it is short. Inspect the value itself.
  - ★ “RelayState should be an opaque token” is also a requirement absent from the source, so it was removed from the variant.
  - ★ Correction 2: The previous version returned satisfied_with_note based solely on a declaration that privacy protection was unnecessary. Because that would create a path for passing a SHOULD through self-declaration, the source’s unless clause was moved to the explicit condition predicate relaystate_privacy_required.

  - ★ Therefore, assessment requires a configuration that reliably excludes ambient authentication. Set testability to CONFIG; if the precondition cannot be established, return not_verified(ambient_auth_not_excludable). This is not nonconformance by the target.
  - ★ Correction: The previous version placed “alternative when the precondition cannot be established: confirm by declaration” in a variant while the control said “return not_verified when the precondition cannot be established,” so they were inconsistent. **Do not return satisfied based only on a declaration.** Record the declaration only as evidence/advisory and keep the outcome as not_verified (to avoid an incorrect MUST PASS).
  - ★ The obligation to re-establish authentication using ForceAuthn is IIP-IDP06.a, and the constraint involving IsPassive is IIP-IDP07.a. This obligation is the general rule underlying those requirements.
  - ★ If this obligation alone results in PASS, an implementation that issues an assertion to any arbitrary principal will pass undetected. Pair it with IIP-SSO01.f / .l.

  - ★ Correction 1: The previous version stated “do not issue an assertion to a party not included in the original <Audience>,” but the source text directly requires the contents of the issued assertion’s <AudienceRestriction>, not a prohibition on issuance itself. That version imposed a stronger obligation
  - ★ Correction 2: The latter part of the source text, “and no <Audience> elements present that were not in the previous <ProxyRestriction> element,” had not been made a variant. It is now stated explicitly as Requirement 2

  - `v-18fc98ef5b` A signature with <ds:Reference>/@URI empty (the entire document) and an XPath transform that excludes part of the content → rejected
  - `v-548ddb7a41` Control: A correct signature containing only permitted transforms → accepted
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ **Core defense against XML Signature Wrapping**. It must provide detection capability equivalent to P0
  - ★ Correction 1: The previous version used roles [idp, sp] and made a **response** excluding AttributeStatement the main variant. That tested only SP <Response> verification and could not demonstrate IdP AuthnRequest verification. They were split by role (the IdP side is IIP-SSO01.fk)
  - ★ Correction 2: The previous version made “a signature containing an unauthorized transform but excluding no content at all (an identity XPath) → may be accepted” a required variant, but the source text states that it is permissible to reject it even when no content is excluded (MAY). Acceptance and rejection are both allowed, so no verdict can be assigned. It was moved to self-validation of the Suite fixture. Self-validation checks only (a) that the fixture signature is cryptographically valid and (b) that the identity transform excludes no content; it does not check the subject’s reason for rejection or whether the subject accepts it
  - ★ Because the subject conforms even if it rejects solely because an unauthorized transform is present, there is no need to distinguish the reason for rejection
  - ★ Evaluation rules:
  - Rejected → satisfied (the source text’s MAY case)
  - Accepted, but no content was excluded from the signed content → satisfied
  - **Accepted a signature that excluded content → violated** (regardless of whether the excluded content was used)
  - Unable to determine whether content was excluded → not_verified
  - ★ The source text requires that “no content of the SAML message is excluded from the signature,” not that excluded content must go unused
  - ★ The observation of “accepted” is determined by whether the subject processed the assertion / message and proceeded (session establishment or application of attributes)
  - ★ Together with IIP-SSO01.ev (a single <ds:Reference> points to the target root), this checks whether the signature actually covers the element being processed

  - `v-c3f6ad120f` Control: an AuthnRequest with a valid signature using only permitted transforms → accepted
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ An attack that excludes the ACS URL from the signed content directly affects implementations that trust the signed request to determine the response destination (and is related to IIP-SSO01.aj / IIP-IDP12.b)
  - ★ The evaluation rules are the same as for IIP-SSO01.ey (reject → satisfied / accept without exclusion → satisfied / accept with exclusion → violated / unable to determine whether exclusion occurred → not_verified)
  - ★ A case using an identity transform is not made a required variant (it has no detection power because the only outcomes are acceptance or rejection). It was moved to self-validation of the Suite-side fixture. Self-validation checks only (a) that the fixture signature is cryptographically valid and (b) that the identity transform does not exclude any content; it does not check the subject's reason for rejection or whether the subject accepts the request
  - ★ Correction: the previous version incorrectly stated that there was no observation opportunity when the configuration accepted unsigned AuthnRequests. Whether the subject requires signatures and the obligation to correctly verify a received signature are separate; the Suite can always send a signed AuthnRequest. If this statement remains, an IdP that never verifies signatures and always accepts requests could escape as “no observation opportunity”
  - ★ For this obligation's case, the Suite always sends a signed AuthnRequest. Use not_verified(test_precondition_signing_key_not_trusted) only when the target cannot be made to trust the Suite SP's key, such as when metadata cannot be registered

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-1053afa95e` The SP (Samlier) sets an alternative identifier using <samlp:ManageNameIDRequest>/<samlp:NewID> → SPProvidedID in subsequent Assertions contains that value.
  - `v-468aec4df7` Update the alternative identifier twice → SPProvidedID contains the latest value (the first value does not remain).
  - `v-2304124410` The alternative identifier set by secondary_peer (another SP) does not appear in SPProvidedID for this SP (pairwise separation).
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ Setting the value once and checking for a match does not verify the “most recently set value.” Update it twice and confirm that the old value does not remain.
  - ★ If the target does not support Name Identifier Management in SAML2Core 3.6, an alternative identifier cannot be established, so the result is NOT_APPLICABLE. Only the omission case (IIP-SSO05.a3) applies.
  - ★ <samlp:Terminate> means “termination of use of the identifier,” not “removal of SPProvidedID” (§3.6.3). Do not create a case that expects the identifier to become omitted after removal.
- **Referenced specification**: `SAML2Core#8.3.7`
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `8\.3\.7 Persistent Identifier||8\.3\.8 Transient Identifier`: Positive-case basis. §8.3.7: “The element's SPProvidedID attribute MUST contain the alternative identifier of the principal most recently set by the service provider or affiliation, if any (see Section 3.6)”
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.6\.1 Element <ManageNameIDRequest>||3\.6\.2 Element <ManageNameIDResponse>`: Means of setting the alternative identifier. §3.6.1: “if the requester is the service provider, the new identifier MUST appear in subsequent <NameID> elements in the SPProvidedID attribute.” <NewID> has type="string", so it can also be used for the xs:string round trip in IIP-G02.c.
- **Notes**: The source text says, “MUST contain the alternative identifier of the principal most recently set by the service provider or affiliation, if any.” “If any” is a conditional clause: when one has been set, it branches to the positive MUST; when none has been set, it branches to the MUST to omit it (IIP-SSO05.a3). The previous version included only the omission side of this branch as a variant and did not test the positive case.

  - `v-337e37618a` The NameQualifier of the re-issued NameID remains the entityID of the upstream Samlier-IdP; it is not rewritten to the target's own entityID.
  - `v-d279d0116c` Control: when the target newly generates and returns its own persistent identifier, NameQualifier is the target's own. Do not mark this as FAIL.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ A test that unconditionally expects “NameQualifier == the entityID of the IdP that sent the response” misclassifies this re-issuance case.
  - ★ The upstream Samlier-IdP and downstream Samlier-SP roles are both played by Test Peers in the same Test Plan. testability is CONFIG because reconfiguration of the target is assumed. Browser interaction is also required at runtime.
  - ★ If the target cannot act as a Proxy, the condition is false → NOT_APPLICABLE. If it merely cannot be configured, the result is not_verified.

It is in scope because IIP-SSO05 incorporates the normative obligations of §8.3.

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ Under the general rule (§8.3.7), NameQualifier may be omitted when it can be inferred from context. Omission is prohibited only in the re-issuance case. These two cases must be paired to distinguish an implementation that always includes it from one that follows the rule.

  - `v-d14758c55d` strong match — identifier: the content and all attributes of the requested Subject's BaseID / NameID / EncryptedID match those of the response Subject's identifier after decryption (only when NameIDPolicy specifies a different Format may the physical values differ, provided they identify the same subject).
  - `v-3da131fa07` strong match — encryption: even if only one of the request and response uses EncryptedID, treat them as matching if their identifiers are identical after decryption.

  - `v-d36db51eb7` Information only: ProviderName / Consent — SAML2Core contains no processing-rule description.
  - `v-805f1e5039` Out of scope (other obligations address the specific processing rules): <NameIDPolicy> → IIP-IDP10 and IIP-SSO01.fl through .fp / <RequestedAuthnContext> exact → IIP-IDP08, minimum/better/maximum → IIP-SSO01.ga through .gc, candidate ordering → .gj / ForceAuthn → IIP-IDP06 / IsPassive → IIP-IDP07 / AssertionConsumerServiceURL, ProtocolBinding, and AssertionConsumerServiceIndex → IIP-IDP12 / AttributeConsumingServiceIndex → IIP-IDP04.b / <Extensions> and <Advice> → IIP-EXT01.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Evaluation rule: only elements for which SAML2Core specifies a unique outcome (error XOR ignore) are verdict subjects. Elements for which either of two outcomes is permitted receive no verdict and are recorded for information only.
  - ★ Correction: the previous version grouped <Scoping>, ProxyCount, and <IDPList> together as information-only because they allowed two outcomes, but SAML2Core 3.4.1.5.1 contains explicit MUST NOT / MUST requirements for ProxyCount and IDPList. Via the incorporated text (SAML2Prof 4.1.3.3), these were decomposed into IIP-SSO01.aw through .bd.
  - ★ Conclusion of the cross-cutting review: among the optional AuthnRequest content, <saml:Conditions>, <RequesterID>, ProviderName, and Consent are not addressed by other IIP requirements or obligations derived from incorporated text, and none has a unique processing rule. Only <saml:Subject>, which has a unique processing rule, is a verdict subject of this obligation.
  - The opening phrase of the source, 'Unless specifically called out by subsequent requirements in this profile,' excludes elements addressed by other IIP requirements from the scope of this obligation.
- **Referenced specification**: `SAML2Core#3.4.1`
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.4\.1\s+Element <AuthnRequest>||3\.4\.1\.1\s+Element <NameIDPolicy>`: List of optional AuthnRequest elements and attributes, and the two-outcome rules for Conditions and AssertionConsumerServiceIndex.
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.4\.1\.4\s+Processing Rules||3\.4\.1\.5\s+`: The unique processing rule for <saml:Subject> (strongly match / error Status).
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.3\.4\s+Processing Rules||3\.4\s+Authentication Request Protocol`: Definition of strongly match (post-decryption identity of the identifier, matching content and attributes, and confirmability of SubjectConfirmation).
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.4\.1\.2\s+Element <Scoping>||3\.4\.1\.3\s+`: <Scoping> / <IDPList> have two permitted outcomes ('MAY examine ... and return an error').
- **Notes**: I directly read SAML2Core 3.4.1 / 3.4.1.4 (saml-core-2.0-os, sha256:dc0890f8…) and finalized the evaluation rules and verdict subjects. This also agrees with the source's non-normative examples (Subject has required semantics, while Conditions has optional semantics).

<details><summary><code>IIP-SP04.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-6db16b8b8e` The Suite acts as the Discovery Service. The target SP redirects the UA to the DS and can continue SSO after receiving the entityID of the selected IdP returned by the DS
  - `v-b863790eec` If the return URL does not contain a parameter with the effective returnIDParam name, do not treat it as returning the identifier of the selected IdP
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Pair a successful result with an empty result. A success-only case cannot detect an implementation that ignores the returned parameter and uses the default IdP
  - Because IdPDisco does not specify the behavior after no selection result is returned, such as the product's own IdP-selection UI, navigation to a default IdP, or displaying an error, do not make it subject to the verdict
  - The MUST/SHOULD statements in IdPDisco section 2 concerning the DS, such as the UI when isPassive is set, the return method, and metadata matching, are fixture rules for the Suite side, which is the Test Peer, and are not obligations of the target SP
  - The MAY provisions for return, policy, returnIDParam, and isPassive authorize their use; they do not require the SP to provide every capability. Judge only the MUST/MUST NOT provisions applicable to the actually selected path in .b through .i
- **Referenced specification**: `IdPDisco`
- **Reference basis (IdPDisco)**; locator: `2\.4 Conformance||2 Identity Provider Discovery Protocol and Profile`: A conformant SP must conform to the normative statements in section 2 concerning SP behavior
- **Reference basis (IdPDisco)**; locator: `2\.4 Protocol Description||2\.4\.1 HTTP Request to Discovery Service`: As the first stage of the two normative message exchanges, the SP redirects the UA to the Discovery Service
- **Reference basis (IdPDisco)**; locator: `2\.4\.3 HTTP Redirect to Service Provider||2\.5 Use of Metadata`: The Discovery Service returns a selection result or an empty result to the SP in the second message exchange
- **Notes**: The non-normative IIP note does not require implementation of a product-specific discovery UI; the scope is support for IdPDisco's simple redirect protocol. The normative IdPDisco content applicable to the SP was decomposed into .b through .i. Normative statements concerning the Discovery Service, and optional parameters that the SP may use, were not made independent obligations of the target SP. The IIP note that “discovery mechanisms SHOULD use SAML metadata…” is also italicized and therefore non-normative, so it is not made an independent obligation

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-4697164eb7` Initiate Discovery and verify in the Transcript that the UA sends an HTTP GET request to the DS endpoint
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Judge only the transport of the message exchange from the SP to the DS. The HTTP GET from the DS to the SP concerns the DS and is placed in the Suite fixture's self-validation

  - If an entityID containing & cannot be configured, fall back to a value that remains a valid absolute URI and requires encoding when embedded in the query, such as the # in https://sp.example.test/id#probe or the % in https://sp.example.test/id%25probe.

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Because support for a custom returnIDParam is MAY, do not require it. For each observed request, judge using the explicit value or the default entityID
  - For every request containing return with no collision, return satisfied; if even one collision occurs, return violated. If a Discovery request was observed but zero requests containing return were observed, return satisfied because the prohibited state did not arise

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Evaluate as a disjunction over messages: return present means satisfied; return absent with an effective default metadata endpoint means satisfied; neither means violated; inability to verify the metadata correspondence means not_verified(metadata_return_basis_undetermined)
  - “When metadata is not used” is a per-request runtime scope, not a condition predicate for the product as a whole. Do not require the capability to provide a configuration without metadata

<details><summary><code>IIP-SP12.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-5885277de2` [Precondition] Execute with a configuration that automatically accepts unknown subjects (automatic provisioning / JIT)
  - `v-bee0d1e4b5` For new subject A, use an opaque pseudorandom value (32 alphanumeric characters) → accepted
  - `v-9cdbfdd8ad` For new subject B, use a value one code point long → accepted
  - `v-8a381bf5cf` For new subject C, use a value 256 code points long → accepted
  - `v-91b5201d94` For new subject D, use a value containing delimiters (@ / = / :) → accepted
  - `v-0dfef821e2` For new subject E, use a value containing no delimiters at all → accepted
  - `v-aff528e732` For new subject F, use a NameID with SPNameQualifier omitted → accepted (§8.3.7 permits omission)
  - `v-9cefd016cc` Control: A value that does not conform to §8.3.7 (257 code points) → may be rejected. Do not mark this as FAIL
  - `v-e0118f8452` Control: New subject with automatic provisioning disabled → rejected. Do not mark this as FAIL either
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ Correction: The previous version said “accept any value conforming to §8.3.7,” but the source says “must not require NameID to have meaning or structure beyond §8.3.7”; it does not prohibit rejection for legitimate non-structural reasons such as an unknown subject, lack of provisioning, or account-linking policy
  - ★ Therefore, make it a test precondition that automatic provisioning is enabled and any new subject can be accepted. If the precondition cannot be met, use not_verified(provisioning_precondition_unmet). This is not nonconformity of the target
  - ★ Correction: The previous version included a variant that issued a different opaque value to the same subject, but this itself breaks the persistence of the persistent identifier. When changing the value, use a different subject or a different IdP
  - ★ If it cannot be determined that the rejection reason was the structure of the NameID, use NOT_VERIFIED. Keep attributes fixed across all variants; change only the NameID. Mark it violated only when the reason is identified through the wording of the error page, audit log, or target self-report
  - ★ An SP that does not work unless the value has an email-address format is a typical violation of this obligation and should be a candidate for a mutant SUT
- **Configuration failure semantics**: `test_precondition`
- **Referenced specification**: `SAML2Core#8.3.7`
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `8\.3\.7 Persistent Identifier||8\.3\.8 Transient Identifier`: The value space that §8.3.7 gives persistent identifiers (opaque, pseudorandom, no more than 256 code points, and the meanings of NameQualifier / SPNameQualifier / SPProvidedID). IIP-SP12 means that structure or content beyond this must not be required
- **Notes**: Correction 1: The previous version classified this obligation as NOT_OBSERVABLE, but §8.3.7 specifies the value space of persistent identifiers, so whether the range is narrowed for structural reasons is observable. Correction 2: However, what is observable is only rejection for structural reasons; the source does not require unconditional acceptance of any value. Because a test precondition (provisioning configuration) is required, testability is CONFIG, and failure to meet the precondition is not a violation but not_verified. Requirements in configuration and deployment documentation are handled as IIP-SP12.b (self-reporting).

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - ★ IIP-SP12.a can observe only behavior toward the set of values sent by the Suite. If the target requires a particular format as a mandatory configuration, it may be that only values satisfying that configuration have been tested
  - ★ If the self-report contradicts the observation under IIP-SP12.a, mark it INCONSISTENT (the self-report says no requirement, but the implementation actually rejects for structural reasons)

  - `v-3915a2be59` The returned Assertion's AuthnStatement/@AuthnInstant is at or after the AuthnRequest IssueInstant.

  - `v-a5344652c4` Control: explicitly set ForceAuthn=false with an existing session; same expectation.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - What is prohibited is reliance on an existing context when ForceAuthn is true. Fresh authentication when false or omitted is not prohibited. A case requiring reuse when false would fail a conforming implementation that always reauthenticates.
  - AuthnInstant alone is weak evidence. Begin with a valid existing session, or the effect of ForceAuthn cannot be distinguished.
  - SAML2Prof 4.1.3.4 states the same rule, but IIP-IDP06 references SAML2Core, so use section 3.4.1 as the basis.

<details><summary><code>IIP-IDP07.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-6189dc7f32` Existing session plus IsPassive=true: return an Assertion without user interaction or visible page transition.
  - `v-0d71fb5c27` No existing session plus IsPassive=true: display no authentication or consent screen; this is the judged property.
  - `v-cdf6d22855` In that case, observe that the returned Response contains an error Status. IIP-IDP05.a owns the verdict; record only the observation here.
  - `v-4d75f46b04` Control: no session with IsPassive omitted, default false, may display authentication UI; do not FAIL it.
  - `v-a0398bfdb6` Consent and attribute-release screens also constitute noticeable interaction and must not appear when IsPassive=true.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Controls for both states—session present and absent—are mandatory; one alone cannot prove support.
  - Correction: the previous version required NoPassive for no session plus IsPassive=true, but SAML2Core 3.4.1.4 makes the secondary status MAY. Absence of NoPassive must not FAIL. Judge only that a Response with an error Status is returned and no visible UI appears.
  - The Suite must directly observe visible UI takeover. Browser automation records intermediate pages and forms. Redirects are not violations if they require no user interaction.
  - The source addresses both the identity provider and user agent, but the conformance target is only the IdP.
  - Returning an error Response is a general SAML2Core 3.4.1.4 rule owned by IIP-IDP05.a; do not judge it twice here.

<details><summary><code>IIP-IDP10.a</code> details</summary>

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-db49b17381` Specify Format=persistent; the request can be processed, with result validation under IIP-IDP10.d.
  - `v-ef43334521` Specify Format=transient; the request can be processed.

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Do not interpret AllowCreate=false as an absolute prohibition on creating identifiers. The source imposes no MUST on the IdP, and SAML2Errata E14 explicitly softens it: the requester tries to constrain creation, but the IdP may assume such information exists.
  - "Can process" means returning a SAML-valid response, either success or an error Status. IIP-IDP10.d judges the returned identifier; IIP-IDP10.b judges error handling.
  - Do not require a particular Format when Format is unspecified or omitted; the source permits any kind of identifier.

IIP-IDP10 alone does not state that errata are incorporated, so this obligation covers base OS Core processing.

- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Key detection control: checking only for a successful response lets an implementation ignore the request and return its default Format.
  - Exclude unspecified and encrypted from applicability, where the source permits any kind of identifier.
  - Correction: the prior basis was the 3.4.1.1 rule requiring an error when content is not understood or acceptable, but that MUST does not require conformance after acceptance. Use 3.4.1.4, requiring assertions that meet the request's specifications.
  - SAML2Errata E15 states the same conclusion explicitly, but IIP-IDP10 does not reference SAML2Core with errata incorporated, so do not use E15 as verdict basis; record it as advisory.

- **Referenced specification**: `SAML2Core#3.4.1.4`
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.4\.1\.4 Processing Rules||3\.4\.1\.5 Proxying`: The basis is 3.4.1.4: the responder MUST ultimately answer AuthnRequest with a Response containing assertions meeting the request's specifications, or a Response with Status describing the error. NameIDPolicy is part of those specifications, so the response must satisfy it or report an error. Section 3.4.1 refers to 3.4.1.4 for general processing, placing this within IIP-IDP10's "as defined in SAML2Core" scope.
- **Reference basis (SAML2Core)**; locator: `3\.4\.1\.4 Processing Rules||3\.4\.1\.5 Proxying`: Corroboration: the same section's strong-match rule allows a different identifier format when specified by NameIDPolicy, presupposing that NameIDPolicy determines identifier format.

  - `v-506e90c9bf` Positive evidence B: specify a binding unusable for Response, HTTP-Redirect or an undefined binding URI; a Response with an error Status is returned, optionally with secondary UnsupportedBinding.
  - `v-5d97fd0b51` Specify ProtocolBinding=HTTP-POST; Response uses POST. This is not positive evidence because POST is the default.
  - `v-d7fa7792d4` Specify ProtocolBinding=HTTP-Redirect; Response is not returned through HTTP-Redirect. Alone this is not positive evidence because IIP-SSO01.x prohibits Redirect.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Detection-critical: "POST requested, POST returned" and "Redirect requested, Redirect not returned" both pass an implementation that entirely ignores ProtocolBinding and always uses default POST. These two alone cannot yield satisfied.
  - Return satisfied only when positive evidence A or B is obtained. If neither is available, return not_verified(no_positive_evidence_for_protocol_binding).
  - If an unsupported binding silently falls back to another binding, processing cannot be distinguished from ignoring; return not_verified.
  - Secondary status is MAY under SAML2Core 3.4.1.4, so absence of UnsupportedBinding alone is not a violation. Evidence B requires an error Status.
  - SAML2Core 3.4.1 makes Index mutually exclusive with URL/ProtocolBinding, but this constrains the requester SP and carries no RFC2119 keyword, so it creates no IdP obligation. Record behavior for requests containing both as advisory.

  - This obligation addresses a canonical SAML vulnerability, open redirection. Pair it with a case where a metadata-listed URL succeeds, or an implementation rejecting everything could PASS.
  - The rule also applies to signed AuthnRequests. SAML2Prof 4.1.4.1 says it applies whether signed or not; create both cases.

- **Required variants**:
  - `v-c213e9b086` Using Suite metadata containing a PAOS ACS and HTTP Basic authentication, complete the basic ECP exchange from SOAP AuthnRequest through SOAP Response or fault.
  - `v-bdd537b3c3` For both success and authentication-failure paths, complete the SAML SOAP binding exchange rather than ending with an HTTP display alone.
- **Controls (negative controls)**:
  - Do not PASS an implementation that merely returns HTTP 200 or that never returns a SOAP Response or fault after HTML login.
  - IIP-IDP13.b makes full conformance OPTIONAL. Do not elevate support for every HoK, X.509, TLS Client Authentication, and client XML Signature capability into this basic capability's MUST.
  - Because the IIP source says all applicable Web Browser SSO requirements apply except IIP-SSO02 and IIP-SSO03, the G2 ECP plan also schedules IdP-applicable IIP-SSO obligations in ECP context. Preserve each obligation's level; do not collapse them into one container MUST that elevates SHOULD or MAY.

- **Notes**: The source excludes token-translation Proxies. ECP v2.0 2.2 makes channel bindings and HoK optional additions to the base profile. IIP makes basic ECP support MUST and full conformance OPTIONAL, while separately making Bearer and channel-binding verification MUST; therefore do not import 3.1.1 full-conformance-only capabilities into .a. Decompose only the IdP actor's basic exchange in 2.3.4–.6 and security rules directly governing it in 2.3.9. Do not duplicate client/SP actor rules from 2.3.1–.4 and .7–.8, optional HoK-specific rules from 2.3.4.1/.5.1/.6.3, metadata consumption from 2.3.10 (IIP-IDP16), or Bearer/channel bindings from IIP-IDP13.c/.d.

Narrowing the IIP's “propagation ... to other session participants” to downstream participants only and restoring upstream sending as SHOULD would circumvent the intended optionality of the IIP's propagation capability; therefore, both paths are included in this OPTIONAL.

  - Do not require a SAML response for an invalidly signed or syntactically invalid request. Do not add an independent requirement to respond to an unauthenticated attacker.
  - This MUST is conditional on successful termination. The IdP's attempt to terminate the session itself is only a Core SHOULD (IIP-IDP17.q), and must not be elevated to MUST here.
